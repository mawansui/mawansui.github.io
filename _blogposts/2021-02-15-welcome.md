Hello! Welcome to my blog. My name is Max. I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Strasbourg University. I study chemoinformatics and methods of computer-aided drug design. Currently I work as part of the TubInTrain consortium, one of the main goals of which is to find small molecules that can modulate tubulin's ability to polymerize into microtubules.

When I started my studies, I soon discovered that computational drug design is a very broad and complicated field. It was a bit hard to get a grasp on it at first, but by reading a number of chemoinformatics-related blogs I got my bearings and even got inspired to start my own blog.

What type of content will you see in this blog?
1. Brief TL;DR abstracts of some articles that I read and found interesting.
1. Reviews of reviews to introduce a reader to a new topic.
2. Quick Hacks â€“ tricks that I either found or came up with myself that help me in my day to day job: chances are that they may help others, as well!
3. Step-by-step tutorials on some chemoinformatics software.

So I guess that's basically it for now. Keep tuned for more!
