Hello! My name is Max. I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Strasbourg University. I study chemoinformatics and methods of computer-aided drug design. Currently I work as part of the TubInTrain consortium, one of the main goals of which is to find small molecules that can modulate tubulin's ability to polymerize into microtubules.

When I started my studies, I soon discovered that computational drug design is a very broad and complicated field. It was a bit hard to get a grasp on it at first, but blogs by such authors as Mr. Iwatobipen ([https://iwatobipen.wordpress.com](https://iwatobipen.wordpress.com/)), Mr. Pat Walters ([http://practicalcheminformatics.blogspot.com/](http://practicalcheminformatics.blogspot.com/)), Mr. Andreas Bender ([http://www.drugdiscovery.net/](http://www.drugdiscovery.net/)), and Mr. Esben Jannik Bjerrum ([http://www.cheminformania.com/about/](http://www.cheminformania.com/about/)) helped me get my bearings and inspired to start my own blog.

There are several reasons why this blog exists. Firstly, I want to share knowledge about chemoinformatics and computational chemistry in simple and clear words and step-by-step instructions. It always helps in structuring one's knowledge to express complex concepts in simple words. It may also help other adventurers that start their journey in the chemoinformatics domain. Secondly, I would like to practice clear and consise writing – and, well, there is no better way to do it than to write! Thirdly, I hope that having this blog will help me keep up-to-date with current research, because I hope to read as much new articles as possible, and post here some very short "Article Essences" of the articles I have read. 

What type of content will you see in this blog?
1. Article Essence – it's just a fun way to say that I have read an article that I found interesting and decided to share a brief abstract of what this article is about.
2. Quick Hacks – this section is dedicated to some quick tricks that I either found or came up with myself that help me in my day to day job: chances are that they may help others, as well!
3. Tutorials – here is where I post longer posts that demonstrate how to use some chemoinformatics software. I found there is a lack fo such step-by-step explanations, and I thought I wanted to do something about it.

So I guess that's basically it for now. Keep tuned for more!
