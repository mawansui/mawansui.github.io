Hi! My name is Max. I am a first-year chemoinformatics Ph.D. student at the University of Strasbourg, France. 
Proud to be a part of TubInTrain – a European Joint Doctorate on chemistry and biology supported by Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions (2020). 

Research and Work Interests
======

My current research interests emanate from my desire to find novel tubulin-targeting ligands that would modulate tubulin polymerization as part of a quest for novel treatment against Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. In order to do so, I:

1. Collect and process publicly-available chemical and bioactivity data, 
2. Perform virtual screening using protein-ligand docking and pharmacophore modeling techniques,
3. Do QSAR modeling using classical machine learning algorithms and novel deep learning methods, and 
4. Perform de novo drug design experiments. 

Using these computational methods, I efficiently discover molecules with potential tubulin-targeting action, which are then evaluated in collaboration with fellow organic chemists and biologists from the TubInTrain programme.

Other Interests
===

In my free time, I like to compose music, read books, and study. I am also an author of several blogs on chemoinformatics, where I post chemoinformatics-related content. 

As such, I manage the `@chemoinfo` Instagram account ([https://instagram.com/chemoinfo](https://instagram.com/chemoinfo)) and a Medium page unpretensiously called `chemoinformatics` ([https://medium.com/chemoinformatics](https://medium.com/chemoinformatics)). I invite you to kindly visit them as well!
