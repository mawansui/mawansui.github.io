Hi! My name is Max. I am a second-year chemoinformatics Ph.D. student at the University of Strasbourg, France. 
Proud to be a part of TubInTrain – a European Joint Doctorate on chemistry and biology supported by Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions (2020). 

This blog is a place where I share chemoinformatics-related things I find useful at my work. This site has three sections. These are [**Blog**](https://mawansui.github.io/blog), [**Quick Hacks**](https://mawansui.github.io/hacks), and [**Tutorials**](https://mawansui.github.io/tutorials). 

The **Blog** is where I post TL;DR-s of various chemoinformatics-related articles. The **Quick Hacks** section is a collection of recepies I find useful in my work. The **Tutorials** section is where I post step-by-step tutorials on popular chemoinformatics software, which I hope will be helpful for beginners in the field.

Research and Work Interests
======

My current research interests emanate from my desire to find novel tubulin-targeting ligands that would modulate tubulin polymerization as part of a quest for novel treatment against Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. In order to do so, I:

1. Collect and process publicly-available chemical and bioactivity data, 
2. Perform virtual screening using protein-ligand docking and pharmacophore modeling techniques,
3. Do QSAR modeling using classical machine learning algorithms and novel deep learning methods, and 
4. Perform de novo drug design experiments. 

Using these computational methods, I efficiently discover molecules with potential tubulin-targeting action, which are then evaluated in collaboration with fellow organic chemists and biologists from the TubInTrain programme.

Other Interests
===

In my free time, I like to compose music, read books, and study. I am an author of several blogs on chemoinformatics, where I post chemoinformatics-related content. 

Apart from this blog, I also manage a Medium page unpretensiously called `chemoinformatics` ([https://medium.com/chemoinformatics](https://medium.com/chemoinformatics)), a `@chemoinfo` Instagram account ([https://instagram.com/chemoinfo](https://instagram.com/chemoinfo)), and a Twitter page at `@mdshev7` ([https://twitter.com/mdshev7](https://twitter.com/mdshev7)). If these social media suit you better, I invite you to kindly visit these pages in a while to check what's new, or simply subscribe to receive updates as soon as I post.
