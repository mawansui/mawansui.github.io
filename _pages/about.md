Hi! My name is Max, I am a first-year chemoinformatics Ph.D. student at the Strasbourg University, France.

Research and Work Interests

I work using various computer-aided drug design techniques. I do virtual screening and stuff.
And currently I'm just trying to see if I can revive this old page of mine. :)
Sorry for the dumb text! Will change it soon. 

Other Interests

In my free time, I like to compose music, write lyrics, read books and study.
