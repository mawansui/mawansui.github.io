Hello! My name is Max. I am a certified chemist passionate about Data Science. This web page is currently under construction. I plan to fill it with some cool stuff, most importantly â€“ my pet projects. Pushing models to production soon!

I am currently employed as an invited researcher at the Strasbourg University, France, where I will stay till December, 2019.

Research and Work Interests
======

I have been working in IT since my schooldays. My first project was an HTML-based textbook for the students of Kazan State Medical University, Russia. It included text, images, navigation and even a test system for the students to test their knowledge.

Later, while studying at Kazan Federal University, I self-taught myself mobile development and got a job in this field. My attention then switched to the Web, for some time I worked as a freelance web developer. After that I learned Python and started working in the Laboratory of Chemoinformatics. There I have taught myself machine learning and data analysis. I have graduated from the University in 2019 with a graduate thesis on the use of advanced neural networks in modern chemistry research.

Parallel to that, I have been working as a research staff member at the Arbuzov Institute of Organic and Physical Chemistry. There I specialized in physicochemical studies of disperse systems of organic compounds.

Other Interests
===

In my free time, I like to compose music, write lyrics, read books and learn Data Science.
